# MonoPCC

This is a PyTorch implementation for **MonoPCC: Photometric-invariant Cycle Constraint for Monocular Depth Estimation of Endoscopic Images**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Our experiments are conducted in a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) environment and you can use the below commands to install necessary dependencies:
```shell
pip3 install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.0
pip install dominate==2.4.0 Pillow==6.1.0 visdom==0.1.8
pip install tensorboardX==1.4 opencv-python  matplotlib scikit-image
pip3 install mmcv-full==1.3.0 mmsegmentation==0.11.0  
pip install timm einops IPython
```


## üíæ Data Preparation

The datasets in our experimental results are [SCARED](https://endovissub2019-scared.grand-challenge.org)(additional application to max.allan@intusurg.com is necessary), [SimCol3D](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/interventional-surgical-sciences/simcol3d-3d-reconstruction-during-colonoscopy-challenge) and [SERV-CT](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/interventional-surgical-sciences/serv-ct).

**SCARED split**

The train/test split for SCARED in our works is defined in the `splits/endovis` and further preprocessing is available in [AF-SfMLearner](https://github.com/ShuweiShao/AF-SfMLearner).


## üìä Evaluation

To prepare the ground truth depth maps, please follow the [AF-SfMLearner](https://github.com/ShuweiShao/AF-SfMLearner/blob/main/export_gt_depth.py). For convenience, here we provide the [model files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13A9TZDETPgEm3D-c37YsGHn8OZcd-VMh?usp=sharing) to reproduce the reported results.

To evaluate model performance on SCARED, you need to run the following command: 
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluate_depth.py --data_path <your_data_path> --load_weights_folder <your_weight_path> \
    --eval_split endovis --dataset endovis  --max_depth 150 --png --eval_mono
```

## Demo of 3D reconstruction

Here we use MonoPCC to estimate depth maps for a video sequence in SCARED, and then perform 3D reconstruction ([ElasticFusion](https://github.com/mp3guy/ElasticFusion)) with the RGB and pseudo depth data:

## ‚è≥ To do

Currently, we have released the evaluation code and model weight files of MonoPCC, which can reproduce the result in our work. In the near future, we will continue to update the complete training code and model zoo.
